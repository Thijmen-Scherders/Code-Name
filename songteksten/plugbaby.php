             Plug In Baby"

            I've exposed your lies, baby
            The underneath's no big surprise
            Now it's time for changing
            And cleansing everything
            To forget your love

            My plug in baby
            Crucifies my enemies
            When I'm tired of giving
            My plug in baby
            In unbroken virgin realities
            Is tired of living

            Don't confuse
            Baby you're gonna lose
            Your own game
            Change me
            Replace the envying
            To forget your love

            My plug in baby
            Crucifies my enemies
            When I'm tired of giving
            My plug in baby
            In unbroken virgin realities
            Is tired of living
            

            [Outro]
            And I've seen your loving
            Mine is gone
            And I've been in trouble
            Wooaahhh
