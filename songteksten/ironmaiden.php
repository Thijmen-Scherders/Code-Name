             [Verse 1: Tom]
            Anne Boleyn, she kept a tin
            Which all her hopes and dreams where in
            She plans to run away with him forever
            (Never to be seen again)
            Leaves a note and starts to choke
            Can feel the lump that's in her throat
            It's raining and she leaves her coat in silence

            [Pre-Chorus: Tom, Dougie, Harry, Danny]
            We're sorry but we disagree
            The boy is vermin, can't you see?
            We'll drown his sins in misery
            Rip him out of history

            [Chorus: Dougie]
            People marching to the drums
            Everybody's having fun to the sound of love
            Ugly is the world we're on
            If I'm right then prove me wrong
            I'm stunned to find a place we belong

            [Post-Chorus: Dougie/Danny]
            Who is your lover?
            I couldn't tell
            When hell freezes over?
            That's when I'll tell
            Who is your lover?
            I couldn't tell, when will this stop?



            [Verse 2: Tom]
            Racing, pacing in the dark
            She's searching for a lonely heart
            She finds him but his heart has stopped
            She breaks down

            [Pre-Chorus: Tom, Dougie, Harry, Danny]
            We're sorry but your majestry
            Refusing orders from the Queen
            Results in a monstrosity
            Remembers a voice and hears him sing

            [Chorus: Dougie]
            People marching to the drums
            Everybody's having fun to the sound of love
            Ugly is the world we're on
            If I'm right then prove me wrong
            I'm stunned to find a place we belong

            [Post-Chorus: Dougie/Danny]
            Who is your lover?
            I couldn't tell
            When hell freezes over?
            That's when I'll tell
            Who is your lover?
            I couldn't tell, when will this stop



            [Instrumental bridge]

                [Chorus: Dougie]
                People marching to the drums
                Everybody's having fun to the sound of love
                Ugly is the world we're on
                If I'm right then prove me wrong
                I'm stunned, to find a place we belong

                [Post-Chorus: Tom/Danny/Dougie]
                Who is your lover?
                I couldn't tell

                I couldn't tell
                When hell freezes over?
                That's when I'll tell
                (People marching to the drums)
                Who is your lover?
                I couldn't tell
                When hell freezes over?
